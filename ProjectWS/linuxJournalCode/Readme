The ZIP contains four web servers in C:

  -- iterative_server.c ;; no concurrency
  -- forking_server.c   ;; concurrency via multiprocessing
  -- threading_server.c ;; concurrency via multithreading
  -- polling_server.c   ;; concurrency via evented-I/O

The iterative_server is not discussed in the Linux Journal article but is included for contrast.

The servers are not production grade; rather, they are illustrations of three ways to concurrency.

The threading_server requires the pthread library and the polling_server requires the epoll library;
hence, these servers will not compile/link on platforms that lack these libraries.

There's a Makefile. At the command prompt,

   make

generates the executables.
